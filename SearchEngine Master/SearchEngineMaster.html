This example will show you how to Search in both major engines (other search engines will be added later, but is easy if you follow the technique) and display a result generated by your own application.<p>
<h3>Explanation:</h3><p>

When you type some KEYWORDS i just send the proper url to the search engines with the keyword included, for Google its http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=[keywords] and for Yahoo: http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=[keywords]<br>
See? Its easy...<p>
Then we need to parse results to 'read' it and display ONLY the results in our own page. Then we look for some patterns that let us identificate the results on each page. Look at the sub inside the project tosee the solution for Google and Yahoo... then if you take your time (maybe 30 minutes or less) you will be able to detect patterns for most Search Engines and in that way you can make your app search not noly in Google or Yahoo.<p>
